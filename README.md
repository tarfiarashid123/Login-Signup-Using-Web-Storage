Login & Signup System Using Web Storage

Overviewliminating the need for a backend database.

Features

This is a simple Login and Signup system implemented using Local Storage and Session Storage in JavaScript. The project includes three main pages: Signup, Login, and Dashboard. User authentication is managed through Web Storage, e

User Signup: New users can register by providing a username, email, and password.

User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials.

Session Management: Users remain logged in using Session Storage.

Local Storage: Stores user credentials securely (hashed for better security).

Dashboard Access: Only logged-in users can access the dashboard.

Logout Functionality: Users can log out to end their session.
